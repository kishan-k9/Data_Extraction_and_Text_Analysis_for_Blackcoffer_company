Our unity is not challenged.Simply, we are all in need of the same resources.There are not many companies in the EU that can produce extempore the necessary PPEs. Some restructuring of theirs and other companies’ modus operandi is needed, but I have every confidence that we will adjust.Shortages in the human sector (i.e. medical personnel) are more difficult to tackle.
